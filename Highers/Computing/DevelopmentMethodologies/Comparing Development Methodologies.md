# Comparing Development Methodologies

| Factor                  | Iterative                                                                                                                                                                      | Agile                                                                                                                                                |

| Client interaction      | The client is heavily involved through Analysis and at the end of Development to make sure its what they want. They are not involved in between.                               | The client is involved through the entire process and gives constant feedback. This means the goals of the project can change during development and can lead to increased client satisfaction.                                                                |
| Teamwork                | Teams of Analysts Programmers and Testers work independently on each phase. The teams work in isolation and only communicate when the project moves from one stage to another. | Teams of developers communicate throughout the project rather than teams in isolation. During a project face to face communication leads to progressing quickly.                                                                                               |
| Documentation           | A detailed project spec is created at the beginning of a project, lots of time is spent on design and test plans.                                                              | Agile focuses on reducing documentation and more time on small cycles of testing coding and adapting to change. Any documentation produced focuses entirely on progressing the project.                                                                        |
| Measuring Progress      | Follows a strict plan, with progress measured against timescales set at the beginning of the project.                                                                          | Follows a strict plan, with progress measured against timescales set at the beginning of the project. Progress is measured by the time it takes to produce prototypes.                                                                                         |
| Adaptive vs. Predictive | Predictive methodology focusing on analysing the future and finding risks. Predictive methods rely on good early phase analysis.                                               | Adaptive methodology, focusing on adapting quickly to change. When the needs of a product changes so does the team. Agile teams have trouble describing in detail what they will do in the future. The further away the date is the harder time they will have |
| Testing                 | Testing is carried out when the implementation phase of the project is complete                                                                                                | There is no recognised testing phase as testing is carried out in conjunction with programming                                                                                                                                                                 |
