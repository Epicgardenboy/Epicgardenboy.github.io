### Garden of Eden and the Book of Genesis

In _Z for Zachariah_, the protagonist, Ann, finds herself alone in a post-apocalyptic world, living in a valley sheltered from the destructive fallout. This isolated setting mirrors the Garden of Eden, a pristine paradise where Adam and Eve lived before their expulsion.

**Key Themes and Parallels:**

- **Loss of Innocence:** Both Ann and Adam and Eve are confronted with the loss of innocence and the introduction of evil into their idyllic worlds.
- **Isolation:** The Garden of Eden and Ann's valley are both isolated spaces, symbolising the human condition and the desire for connection.
- **Temptation:** Ann faces the temptation to leave her safe haven, similar to Adam and Eve's temptation to eat from the forbidden tree.

**Why has it ended?** In the context of _Z for Zachariah_, the Garden of Eden-like existence has ended due to a catastrophic event, likely a nuclear war. This event symbolises the consequences of human sin and the fragility of civilisation.

### Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War

The Cuban Missile Crisis, a tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1962, was a defining moment of the Cold War.

**Key Facts and Dates:**

- **October 1962:** The Soviet Union began secretly deploying nuclear missiles to Cuba.
- **October 16, 1962:** U.S. spy planes discovered the missiles, escalating tensions.
- **October 22, 1962:** President John F. Kennedy announced a naval blockade of Cuba and demanded the removal of the missiles.
- **October 28, 1962:** The Soviet Union agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for the U.S. promising not to invade Cuba.

**Impact on Ordinary People:** The Cuban Missile Crisis, while relatively brief, had a profound impact on ordinary people around the world. The threat of nuclear annihilation created a sense of fear and uncertainty. The crisis also led to increased tensions between the superpowers, contributing to the arms race and the Cold War's continued dominance of international politics.

### History of Conflict Between Science and Religion

The conflict between science and religion is a complex and multifaceted issue with a long history. It has manifested in various forms throughout different cultures and time periods.

**Ancient Civilisations:**

- **Greek Mythology:** The Greek gods were often associated with natural phenomena, leading to a blending of mythology and early scientific observations.
- **Egyptian Astronomy:** The Egyptians developed sophisticated astronomical knowledge for religious and practical purposes.

**Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution:**

- **Scientific Revolution:** The rise of scientific inquiry challenged traditional religious beliefs, leading to conflicts over the interpretation of the Bible and the natural world.
- **Age of Reason:** Enlightenment thinkers emphasised reason and empirical observation, often clashing with religious dogma.

**Modern Issues:**

- **Eugenics:** The misuse of scientific knowledge to promote racial purity and genetic engineering raised ethical concerns and conflicts with religious values.
- **Roe v. Wade:** The U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalising abortion sparked intense debates about the role of science, religion, and government in determining moral and ethical issues.
- **Climate Change:** The scientific consensus on climate change has faced challenges from religious groups who may interpret the issue through a biblical lens.
